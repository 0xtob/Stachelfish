BOLD RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 1.0, 8 August 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Amand Tihon <amand.tihon@alrj.org>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This Bold Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use Bold to link a program, Bold may combine portions of
certain Bold runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose
of this Exception is to allow linking non-GPL (including proprietary)
programs to use, in this way, the runtime libraries covered by this
Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Linking Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"Bold" means a version of the Byte Optimized Linker, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with Bold in accord with
the license of Bold.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Linking Process" combines Target Code in intermediate object form,
into a single executable program.

A Linking Process is "Eligible" if it is done using Bold, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on Bold. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any Bold intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Linking Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of Bold Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of Bold.
