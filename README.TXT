A quick 4k intro for Evoke 2010, made at the party
in 26 hours:

18h learning about shaders, 0.5h sound, 2h crunching,
6h sleep, 0.5 beer, 1h error tolerance

We thank iq/rgba for his great tutorials on raymarching,
jix/titan for providing his laptop for beaming, and the
Evoke organizers for being just awesome!
